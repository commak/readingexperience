				<p class="text1">

<strong> John Locke </strong> saw the primary purpose of education as being that of instilling within children a real and important understanding of the need for virtue, a consideration that currently lies at the heart of much of the thinking around social reform in the UK. Locke was also far ahead of his time in that he saw that learning should be enjoyable and that children benefit from being encouraged to learn how to learn. He also recognized the important role that language played in learning. Indeed, it can be said with confidence that Locke set out many of the basic foundations upon which our current understanding of learning has been built. Indeed, others such as Pestalozzi, Froebel, Dewey and Montessori who followed Locke shared much of his thinking. We now turn to the work of another influential philosopher who, in challenging the thinking of his time, saw the importance of acknowledging the individuality of children and the potential they bring with them when they are born. In doing so, he not only advanced our understanding of learning but introduced us to new ways of conceptualizing childhood as that most important of times when individuals grow and develop socially and emotionally.

<strong> Jean-Jacques Rousseau </strong> , despite being born generations ago, his ideas still hold credence today. The dominant thinking of the time in which Rousseau lived was that we are born with ‘original sin’ and a primary function of education was to purge children of this sin and the associated guilt that went with it. In contrast, however, Rousseau believed that we are all born ‘good’ and that we inherit much of what makes up our individual potential. Nevertheless, he recognized that society also played an important role in influencing children as they develop. In particular, he recognized the potential harm that aspects of society could have on children in terms of perverting their thinking and behaviours.
</p>
	<p class="text1">
Rousseau set out his ideas on education in his celebrated book <strong> Emile </strong> (1911) in which he introduces us to the life of a young boy named Emile as he progresses from infancy through to adulthood. At the time of writing Emile it was popularly
believed that children were born with internal drives, needs and impulses, which
if not addressed could lead to ‘wickedness’. For Rousseau, a central feature of
education, and especially the role of a child’s tutor was to channel these drives,
needs and impulses in a positive and purposeful way. He believed that the process of formal education should endeavour to follow the natural growth of the child as opposed to demands made by society. Rousseau viewed the role of the tutor, therefore, as extremely important and central to the process of developing positive and effective learning environments, particularly where the child is being introduced to new learning. It was through this process that Rousseau believed children came to know and understand the world within which they live. More specifically, he believed that through this process children internalize greater understandings of such vital constructs as, respect for themselves and others, right and wrong, consequences of their actions, honesty and dishonesty, and humility and empathy. For Rousseau, the core function of education was, ‘l’art de former des hommes’ (the art of forming men) and he viewed education as the mechanism through which children should not only be given information, but a means by which they could come to benefit society through, for example, learning how to positively and purposefully relate to one another.

Although writing some three hundred years ago, Rousseau recognized how children and young people pass through stages and in doing so recognized that learning is developmental. For Rousseau, the first stage that children went through was from birth to 12 when children were predominantly influenced by impulses and by their emotions. The second stage was up to the age of 16 when, Rousseau believed, reason took over and began to replace actions led by emotions and impulses. Following this second stage, the young person then moves into adulthood. It should be recognized that Rousseau’s emphasis upon the innate development of human nature formed the philosophical basis for the views of future thinkers and practitioners, perhaps most notably, those of Pestalozzi.
We now turn to the work of one of the great giants of learning, many of whose
ideas remain with us today to such an extent that they are experiencing a significant revival. Whilst most of Froebel’s work pertained to early childhood, he nevertheless contributed significantly, as did Rousseau, to our understanding of how early learning prepares us for later development and eventually adulthood.

It can be said with confidence that <strong> Friedrich Froebel </strong> has had an enormous influence upon the practice of teachers and Early Years practitioners over the centuries and continues to do so, even today. Indeed, Miller and Pound (2011, p. 64) recently commented: Froebelians continue to influence official documents in a behind-the-scenes way ... from the Hadow report (1933) onwards, through to Plowden (Central Advisory Council for Education, 1967);
Starting with Quality (DES, 1990); Curriculum Guidance for the Foundation Stage (DfEE, 2000); Birth to Three Matters (DfES, 2002); The Early Years Foundation Stage (CCSF, 2008). Miller and Pound (2011, p. 64) have drawn further attention to the recent emergence of Froebel training, which they report as follows:
'... the Froebel Certificates have recently been re-established at Roehampton University and are developing in Edinburgh ...' the next generation of Froebelians is emerging, trained, in the practical apprenticeship way, in reflective practice through in-service training.
Practitioners owe much to Froebel’s emphasis upon the importance of play and its role in education as well as social and emotional development. Whilst all practitioners now recognize the value of play this was not always the case, and certainly was not the case when Froebel was developing his philosophy of education and his beliefs around the value of play. Froebel felt strongly that young children could express themselves through play and the extent of his contribution to our under standing of play is today widely recognized. Tizard and Hughes (1984, p. 4), for example, commented as follows:
</p>
	<p class="text1">
The value of learning through play was first put forward by Friedrich Froebel. The kindergarten and nursery school movement which developed from his writings freed young children from the tyranny of sitting in rows chanting and writing ABC.
In essence, Froebel saw play as being central to children’s learning and development. Because of his strongly held views about the importance of play he created a range of special educational materials that could be employed by practitioners working with young children. These materials or gifts , as Froebel called them, included, for example, a range of shaped objects such as squared blocks and spheres, which could be used with the purpose of stimulating thinking and learning. 
</p>
	<p class="text1">
Froebel also believed that being active was central to children’s learning and development and because of this he developed a number of what he referred to as occupations. In addition, Froebel recognized the important role that music could play in the learning of young children and, in particular, the value of children singing whilst they were playing. Froebel has left us with not just an important way of thinking about education but also a legacy of how to work, in practice, with children. In many respects Froebel set the scene for those who followed to explore further, and in depth, the inner lives of children and, importantly, those emotional, creative and cognitive aspects that underpin learning and inform education and schooling. One such follower whose ideas, like those of Froebel, continue to influence practice today is Rudolf Steiner.
</p>
	<p class="text1">
The influence that <strong> Rudolf Steiner </strong> has had on our understanding of learning and
teaching has been substantial. This said, there are those who hold a less than
favourable view of him and his work has caused, and continues to cause, controversy amongst some practitioners. He has even been referred to as, ‘a maverick Austrian scientist’ (Edwards, 2002, p. 2). Currently, there are more than a thousand Steiner schools, and over two thousand Early Years establishments around the world. Despite the original philosophy remaining constant, however, many of these schools have developed in different ways.
</p>
	<p class="text1">
A central feature of the Steiner-Waldorf tradition is the belief that young children
learn by imitation. Steiner founded his first school in the city of Stuttgart after being invited to do so by a leading industrialist, Waldorf Astoria, who at the time was the owner of a very large cigarette factory. The purpose of the school was to educate the children of the workers in the factory hence the legacy by which Steiner schools came also to be known as Steiner-Waldorf schools. A central feature of the Steiner-Waldorf tradition is the belief that young children learn by imitation. Miller and Pound (2011, p.88) describe this perception held by Steiner-Waldorf practitioners thus, ‘... and whatever is happening around the child becomes part of that child as she absorbs not only the outer actions of the adults, but the inner attitudes too’. The nature of the relationship between the practitioner and the child is of the utmost importance and central to the learning of the child. Miller and Pound (2011, p. 92) have commented as follows:
</p>
	<p class="text1">
Steiner practitioners observe that young children are nurtured by the security of rhythm and
repetition – within which their inherent skills and abilities can flourish ... Having well thought
through and repeated routines build habits that are useful (properly washed hands), respectful
(creating a peaceful mood at the table) and comforting (‘this is how we always do it here’).
Steiner saw the function of education as that of responding to the changing needs of children and by this he not only meant their physical needs but also their intellectual needs and, perhaps most notably, their emotional needs. Underpinning the Steiner philosophy are the following key points. In the first years of a child’s education up to the age of seven significant emphasis is placed upon the importance of play, drawing and art, and the natural world of the children, with important links made between science and art. Before the age of seven children are not formally taught reading, the reasoning being that children will come to read naturally if they have developed socially and emotionally. This is also the case with mathematics, with children being introduced to formal mathematics at a later stage than children in state schools. 
</p>
	<p class="text1">
<strong> The Steiner philosophy </strong> also advocates that children are taught to write before being taught to read. Children in Steiner-Waldorf schools are encouraged to sing every day and also to learn to play musical instruments. In addition, children are introduced to the practice of creating their own lesson books in which they are encouraged to write and illustrate. Assessment of children takes place mainly through the teacher’s observation, with a particular focus being given to the children’s social and emotional development. Where possible each child keeps the same teacher throughout their primary schooling until they are due to transfer to the post-primary stage. The thinking behind this is that children come to value the importance of relationships, and, in addition, gain from the knowledge that the teacher has of their social and emotional development.
</p>
	<p class="text1">
A further characteristic of Steiner schools is that teachers employ a ‘narrative’
approach to learning. In doing so, they place significant emphasis on listening, with the children being encouraged to internally represent characters. In this way they develop their imagination. Once introduced to material by way of a story the children may then be encouraged and supported in revisiting the content on the next day and retelling it. Here, the aim is to improve spoken language and, perhaps more interestingly, memory. As this process of listening and recalling are worked through children are then supported in writing down their stories. Observation plays an enormous part in the practice of teachers in Steiner-Waldorf schools. Nicol has indicated some of the key principles that inform the practice of the kindergarten teacher working in Steiner-Waldorf schools who:
'... understands that learning and development is of course a continuous process, and may wait patiently to watch these unfold ... uses insight rather than measurement: the question is: ‘Who are you?’ rather than ‘What can you do?’ ... respects and refrains from hurrying the child’s natural speed of development ... meditates on the child, holds the child in his/her thoughts (a process termed as ‘inner work’) ... is aware of and engaged in his or her own self-development.' It is worth considering some of these key principles within the context of current practice in primary schools and Early Years settings.

To properly understand the contribution that <strong> Rachel and Margaret McMillan </strong> have made to our understanding of learning requires that we also understand the social world within which they lived and worked. London at this time was a city of marked contrasts between the rich and poor. It was a time of much-needed social reform and like many other industrialized cities of the time was characterized not only by extreme wealth and privilege but also by extreme poverty, poor sanitation, high mortality rates in childhood, appalling housing, and some of the worst slums in Europe. Between 1831 and 1866 around 150,000 individuals died of cholera. Londoners living during the 1840s could have expected a life span of 30 to 40 years, whilst by 1911 they could, on average, expect to live until they were in their fifties (Hall, 1998, p. 695). It has been estimated (Horn, 1997) that between 1900 and 1950 there existed within London around 30,000 homeless children who lived on the streets. These children were typically, undernourished, uneducated and unsupervised. It was not until 1899, 10 years after Rachel had moved to London to be with her sister and the first murders of the infamous Jack the Ripper had been reported, that school attendance was made compulsory.

	<p class="text1">
After a sustained campaign the sisters were successful in their quest to have free school meals for children introduced, which followed the passing of the Provision of School Meals Act in 1906. It is interesting that this is now a topic under discussion by many local authorities in the UK. The sisters were also highly influential in having the government introduce medical inspections for children in schools, with the first clinic opening its doors in 1908. Rachel and Margaret were particularly outspoken in their insistence that the first years of a child’s life were of the utmost importance and, true to their belief, they founded what was to become the Nursery Movement. As part of their determination to alter for the better the lives of children, they emphasized the benefits of open-air learning. In many respects this was in response to the overcrowded and filthy living conditions experienced by the thousands of children growing up and being educated in cities. In 1904 Margaret published Education through the Imagination, and in her later years played an influential role in the training of teachers. She went on to found the Rachel McMillan College in 1930 for this purpose and as a means of improving the training of those wishing to work with young children in her nurseries. Like Margaret, Rachel believed that involving children in nurseries with caring for animals and plants was an important means of developing within them the important values of caring not only for themselves but also for others.
