"Childhood" is an ancient word in English, not a young one. The Oxford English Dictionary takes as its earliest example for "cildhad" an English gloss inserted during the tenth century between the lines of the Lindisfarne Gospels. The meaning expressed there appears consistent with the most literal strand of our contemporary usage: this passage from the Gospel of Mark ("soð he cuoeð from cildhad"; 9:21) employs childhood as a temporal marker: a father explains to Jesus that his son had been wracked by fits since the earliest years of his life. The miraculous cure Jesus performs stands as a test of belief and a compelling instance of the power of prayer. The gathered crowd, the disciples, and generations of interpreters since have voiced many questions about this scene and what it means, but no one questions the meaning of childhood. This apparent clarity-the confident unanimity over the implications and significance of "childhood"-is perhaps the most potent, and indeed dangerous, thing about this keyword. We have, it seems, a miraculous faith in childhood itself. 
<br>
"The child, and stories about the child," Adam Phillips explains, "have become our most convincing essentialism" (1998). Ever since Philippe Ariès's (1962) provocative assertion that "in medieval society the idea of childhood did not exist," historians of childhood, scholars of children's literature, even psychoanalysts like Phillips, have striven to dismantle the essentialism of childhood. These accounts stress the complicated relations, and often glaring contradictions, between any society's idea of childhood and the lived experience of actual children. They offer persuasive evidence both of how attitudes toward childhood have changed over time and place, and of how much the content and duration of this life stage has differed even for children in the same society but of different genders, races, or class positions. Such studies reveal that ideas about childhood frequently articulated differences of status: modes of schooling and play serve as prime markers of class identity, of differences between boys and girls even within the same family, of the transition from an agricultural to an urban/industrial economy, and of racial inequality. Changes in children's literature have not only reflected these various biases, but in many ways served to create and disseminate them. The different models of behavior and desire voiced in Louisa May Alcott's Little Women (1868–69) and Thomas Bailey Aldrich's The Story of a Bad Boy (1869) schooled their readers in gender norms, and in their realist detail these books have similarly informed historians' accounts of mid-nineteenth-century American girlhood and boyhood. The idea of the child is repeatedly made and remade in the stories told to children.
<br>
Yet despite such constructionist scholarship, the sense of childhood as a ubiquitous and fundamental category of human life has proved remarkably resilient. Belief in the universal and unchanging essence of childhood can make all sorts of cultural arrangements and power structures appear natural. The configuration of the family and of gender roles, the socializing institutions of education, class and racial formations, literary and other forms of cultural production, national security, religious and sexual virtue all tout the needs of the child. Seen this way, children appear less as the object of control than as a rationale for regulation in general. Worse, the concept of childhood dependency has frequently been used to naturalize a lack of autonomy, not only for the young, but for all sorts of subservient people. In cases of poverty, colonial status, and racial or gender oppression, analogies to childhood easily implement exclusion from civil rights. "If politics is ultimately about the distribution of power," Henry Jenkins argues, "then the power imbalance between children and adults remains at heart a profoundly political matter" (1998). The question persists: How and why do evocations of childhood succeed so often and so well in enforcing social norms and justifying social hierarchies? </p>

<p class="text1">
I suspect the essentialism of childhood has proved this resilient and convincing because it rests, at least in part, upon biological fact. Unlike the months, or days, or even hours of dependency for most animals, human young require years of training and protection before they are capable of surviving on their own. The need for care is indeed a natural and essential aspect of children's lives, as is children's growing self-reliance. Young children everywhere must be fed, carried, taught to speak, and prepared to function appropriately within their particular social world (Stearns 2009). The complexities of the idea of childhood, and the conflicting ways this keyword has been wielded, all harken back to this sense of beginnings, to the general trajectory from dependency toward autonomy, but there consensus ends. Few areas of human life are at once so universally shared and so differently experienced and understood. Is the mewling infant darling or bestial, the roaming youth a crusader or a truant, the laboring child valued or abused, the child reader virtuous, imaginative, or indolent? Childhood may be widely recognized as a life stage that stretches from birth until the taking on of adult competence and responsibility, but its contours and meanings are deeply circumstantial, formed by the particulars of each historical and social situation, and the stories we tell about them. Perhaps it is because childhood simultaneously roots itself in both biological and ideological ground that it proves so potent a means of naturalizing cultural formations. 
<br>
Changes in the status of children are notable for what they indicate about shifts in social priorities, that is, for what they reveal about alterations in the desires and behaviors of adults. Ideas of childhood, however, are not only an adult concern. Ethnographic projects with contemporary children and archival research on the diaries, letters, and school compositions that children produced in earlier periods have enabled scholars to measure the gap between children and childhood, not only interrogating how adults' ideas about childhood inform children's experiences, but also documenting children's participation in the discourses of childhood. The letters written to the Children's Aid Society by nineteenth-century street children skillfully manipulate the philanthropic rhetoric of vulnerable child waifs to serve their own, often oppositional, needs (Sánchez-Eppler 2005). Children's literature plays a powerful part in these dynamics, mediating between societal ideas and child actors. Charles Loring Brace's work with the Children's Aid Society inspired Horatio Alger, Jr.'s "rags-to-riches" tales, and the Society's lodging houses for newsboys happily stocked Alger's novels and used them to promote newsboy savings accounts and other improving habits such as reading. Ideas of childhood inform a broad array of practices, institutions, and ways of thinking about human identity; genre shifts within children's literature have both spurred and been spurred by such changes. 
<br>
As the example of Alger suggests, books written for children remain one of the best gauges we have for a particular society's views of childhood, and one that we know children themselves engaged with directly. The books written for children instruct the young in how their particular culture understands their role. Literacy primers, school books, and conduct manuals were produced for young readers since at least the late Middle Ages, but until the eighteenth century most childhood reading was gleaned from books primarily intended for adults. The publication of literature explicitly for children burgeoned into a flourishing wing of the publishing business with John Newbery's line of "toy books" in the 1740s (Avery 1995). The success of Newbery's offerings depended upon a new conception of childhood, which presumed that children should be sufficiently literate and leisured to make use of such volumes, that children's skills and taste as readers would differ enough from that of adults to warrant such separate publications, and that enough parents would be interested in pleasing and instructing their children to make such a specialized line profitable. The collection of illustrated alphabet cards and other reading aids, including home-made story books, which Jane Johnson carefully created for her four children, predates Newbery's commercial publications by a few years and attests to the intense desire in such affluent households for materials that would make reading instruction pleasurable (Arizpe and Styles 2004). Thus the very notion that there should be books produced specifically for child readers in itself indicates a great deal about the evolution of the idea of childhood. </p>

The gloss in the Lindisfarne Gospel treats childhood as an easy temporal marker, but the "when" of childhood has in fact proved remarkably variable. In medieval Europe the notion of the "ages of life" provided a familiar symbolic frame, neatly dividing the human life span into distinct periods with specific social roles and clearly defined expectations. Infancy and childhood inaugurated these iconic series, but such life stages were not understood as tightly correlated to chronological age (Ariès 1962). Gary Dickson (2009) argues that the twelfth-century "Children's Crusade" served as a means of marking the passage from pueri to adulthood in a social world in which merely growing older did not necessarily enable a shift of status, especially for the rural poor. Later bureaucratic and institutional structures would increasingly depend on the more precise divisions offered by years, flanking childhood with the question, "How old are you?" (Chudacoff 1989). Whether through the increasingly rigorous recording practices of parish and state registers of birth in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the age groupings of graded classrooms that would become standard educational practice in the mid-nineteenth century, or the exacting calibrations of developmental psychology in the twentieth, chronological age-gauged in years, not skills or activities-has gradually become a bulwark of identity.
<br>
This attention to age has resulted in ever more normative claims about the temporal limits of childhood, although the slightest prodding reveals them to be shallow claims indeed. The child mill-workers and miners of the Industrial Revolution, whose small, dexterous fingers and capacity to squeeze down shafts too low or thin for adults turned these five and six year olds into arduous and cheap workers, labored during the very period when children in the middle and professional classes began taking on more years of schooling before employment (Tuttle 1999). Still, the conviction that childhood can be measured in years is one of the ways that assertions about the nature of childhood gain authority and the aura of universality. Anna Barbauld's Lessons for Children from Two to Three Years Old (1778) demonstrates that from the first decades of children's publishing a conception of childhood measured in years structured the market, even though it would be nearly a century before schools generally divided students and their lessons by age rather than ability (Chudacoff 1989). By the nineteenth century not only child readers, but also child characters were increasingly described by age-thus we are told that Alice enters Wonderland on her seventh birthday, and A. A. Milne merges child reader and child character in the identity of years: "now we are six." 
<br>
Ariès (1962) argues that during the Middle Ages and early modern period, children might have been loved and cared for, but their lives were largely undifferentiated from those of adults. His account of the "invention of childhood" as a distinct social category during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries presents it as an idea constructed by historical forces in response to more general cultural needs; thus he shows the specific utility of the idea of the child as different from adults in sanctioning the learned classes now needed to train the young, and in privatizing the family now needed to protect the innocent. Although he tends to base his arguments on other evidence (how children are represented in paintings, the gradual creation of distinctive dress for the young, the way parents write about their offspring in letters and journals), clearly the rise of children's publishing near the end of this period confirms that such a transformation had indeed been achieved. In narrating how the concept of childhood was forged in early modern Europe, Ariès does not present a narrative of progress. The alternately "coddled" and "disciplined" childhoods that emerge have in their different ways lost much of the autonomy and latitude that he identified in the lives of premodern children. Thus the vulnerabilities associated with modern conceptions of childhood prove double-edged: they elicit tenderness and care, but they also disallow agency.</p>

<p class="text1">
Most accounts of Euro-American conceptions of childhood note how the development of these ideas has followed a general trajectory from the stern and punitive to the doting and indulgent. Yet for individual theorists, and in the daily life of culture, any such tidy history of ideas has tended to mix and muddle in ambivalent practice. The concept of "infant depravity" expressed in John Wesley's insistent plea-"Do not give up your child to his own will, that is, to the devil. Though it be pain to yourself, yet ... make them submit" (1784)-expresses an understanding of childhood as a period of innate and inevitably sinful desires, but also gives voice to a desperate concern for children's ultimate wellbeing. Thus, accounts of shifts in the history of childhood that simply veer from a cruel reliance on the "rod" to a doting array of gifts and endearments mishear the anguished cherishing in these injunctions. 
<br>
John Locke's (1690) depiction of the child as a tabula rasa, not already tainted by sin but simply waiting to be inscribed by experience, presents childhood in a manner both more benign and more passive than that offered by evangelical accounts of devilish will. Victorian child-rearing manuals would make Locke's epistemological thesis into a paean of malleability and a justification of parental authority: "Like clay in hands of the potter, they are waiting only to be molded" (quoted in Kincaid 1992, 90). Jean-Jacques Rousseau inverted the assumptions of infant depravity, instead declaring adulthood corrupt and the social world a sad decline from natural innocence. In Émile, or On Education (1762), Rousseau urged parents to "leave childhood to ripen in your children" (1979), but this idealization of childhood as a period of freedom and natural goodness did not actually grant children much latitude. Émile's tutor, after all, trusts to the boy's capacity for observation and induction, but the goals of this training remain firmly in the tutor's hands. 
<br>
These competing theories of childhood seeded quite different assumptions about the most appropriate stories to tell to children, ranging from didactic to playful. Locke's image of the child's mind as a "white paper void of all characters" conflates child and page in a way that seems particularly illuminating for a discussion of children's literature, since it presents ideas and identity as not only strongly marked but powerfully embodied by the pages we read as children. The ideas of childhood proffered by Locke and Rousseau melded to disrupt older strategies of child-rearing, resulting by the mid-nineteenth century in an explicitly new set of goals for children's literature: "[W]e have ceased to think it the part of wisdom to cross the first instincts of children, and to insist upon making of them little moralists, metaphysicians, and philosophers, when great nature determines that their first education shall be in the senses and muscles, the affections and fancies" (Osgood 1865). Such changes in the content and purpose of childhood reading prove formative not only for the individual but for the culture. As Gillian Brown (2001) details, Locke's pedagogical models did as much as or more than his political theories to inform American revolutionary conceptions of governmental authority and consent. Similarly, Andrew O'Malley (2003) explains the genre shifts of children's literature from didacticism to humor, adventure, and fantasy in terms of political economy, suggesting that the moralizing children's books of the eighteenth century not just reflected but actually fostered the development of industrial capitalism, training docile workers and frugal masters. Thus, he suggests, the burgeoning of imaginative children's literature can be read as a sign of the secure triumph of the middle class, finally confident enough to play.

	<p class="text1">
Children themselves participate in the construction of these different ideas of childhood, and these different attitudes toward children's books. Scraps of writing left behind by two young girls in mid-nineteenth-century New England articulate the change Osgood described and demonstrate the fluidity with which conflicting ideas about childhood can coexist even for children from fairly similar backgrounds. Lilly St. Agnan Barrett, whose father owned a dye house in Malden, Massachusetts (just north of Boston), penciled this pledge on a small piece of torn card: "I will try this day to live a simple sincere serene life; repelling every thought of discordant self-seeking an [sic] anxiety; cultivating magninimity [sic] self-control and the habit of silence; practicing economy cheerfulness and helpfulness" (c. 1856). Her hesitant handwriting and a vocabulary somewhat in advance of her spelling suggest she was probably somewhat under ten years old. Lilly's pledge charts the process of socialization to a docile domesticity, as she strives to subdue any discordant aspects of her childhood self. Eliza Wadsworth, the ten-year-old daughter of a successful farmer in West Hartford, Connecticut, added sly phrases in a small penciled script after many of the lessons in her Practical Spelling-Book (1861): "Do you not love bread and milk?" concludes the lesson entitled "The Grist-mill"; "No I'll bet I don't," writes Eliza. She inserts the simple words "no yes" beneath the book's printed question "Good boys and girls try to behave well at school because it makes their parents happy. Do you do so?" Eliza may not behave well at school, but she still makes her parents happy; splitting obedience from the notion of parental pleasure, she takes pride in willful rebellion and seems to suspect that her parents will too. The differences between these girls' understanding of their childhood role, and the divergent ways they deploy their fledgling literary skills, suggests the fluidity of cultural change and the function of reading and writing in the redefinition of childhood. 
<br>
The mid-nineteenth-century flourishing of children's literature as a site for fantasy and play ultimately produced a sense of childhood less as a period of preparation for adult life than as a time magically and wonderfully separate from it-a period where, as Eliza seems to feel, the rules don't really apply. Childhood from this perspective appears so different from the rest of life that it becomes another place entirely. Virginia Woolf's lovely phrase for it-"that great cathedral space which was childhood" (1939)-is loaded with awe and beauty but also (this is Woolf, after all) with ironic pieties. All the magical places of children's literature (Wonderland, Neverland, Narnia, Oz, where the wild things are) understand childhood in these topical terms as someplace else, asserting a distance ripe for nostalgia. There is obvious class bias in the luxurious abundance of these fantasies, and indeed a way in which they sentimentalize and absolve inequalities, since even Hans Christian Andersen's destitute "Little Match Girl" can feel warmed by the glow of her imagination.

	<p class="text1">
The sense of childhood as a time and space of enchantment intriguingly mirrors the development of psychoanalysis (Blum 1995). Psychoanalytic theory gave a new primacy to childhood as the origin of the adult self and its inchoate desires. In particular, Sigmund Freud's account of infantile sexuality and the processes of its repression served to equate the unconscious with childhood. Carolyn Steedman (1995) goes so far as to credit the figure of the child with grounding the modern concept of the self with its personal history and individual interiority. Thus, by the late nineteenth century childhood had become a locus of memory and imagination, a "secret garden," whose characteristics are in many ways shared with those of fiction itself. 
<br>
At the beginning of the twenty-first century such an idealized romance of childhood appears to many cultural critics as something lost, or on the verge of loss. The hectic pace of modern life, the stress of high-stakes testing, the juvenilization of poverty, and the commercialization of desire all seem to threaten the sacred pastoral of childhood. Television and video games besiege the golden citadel of children's literature (Postman 1994), and the ravaged figure of the child soldier explodes the myths both of childhood adventure and of childhood security (Briggs 2005). Resisting childhood's essentialism, recognizing the constructed nature of this idyll, puts the language of crises in historical perspective. Pub signs and other commercial interests infiltrated alphabet primers from as early as the seventeenth century (Crain 2000), and as William Blake's Songs of Innocence and Experience (1794) insists, romantic celebrations of childhood were always shadowed by grim alternatives. Anne Higonnet (1998) urges that we replace the investment in childhood innocence with the recognition of the "knowing child," a figure aware of the world's threats and desires but still deserving of adult protection. We would do better at tending to the real needs and situations of children if we were to forgo our miraculous faith in any essential and singular idea of childhood. The historical record reveals the broad array both of ideas of childhood and of children's ways of living it. Contemporary "American society is unique in its assumption that all young people should follow a single, unitary path to adulthood," Steven Mintz observes with disapproval (2004). The plural "childhoods" could prove a more honest and productive keyword, and children's literature may help inscribe this change by telling an ever wider array of new and different stories.
