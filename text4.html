				<p class="text2">
Play in early childhood education (ECE) is a very broad topic that continues to generate much discussion and debate. Slogans such as “play is the business of childhood” or “play is the child's way of learning” are still heard but they are becoming less convincing. Voicing slogans such as these often encourages those who are opposed to play in education to dismiss it on the grounds that the idea seems too broad and vague to be a valid and useful basis for teaching and learning. It doesn't help when ECE programs claiming to be play-centered lack a thoughtful rationale for their play policies and practices or when low-level, unchallenging activities called “play” abound in their indoor and outdoor environments. This threatens the place of play in the ECE by inviting misguided attacks on it and by encouraging educators to devalue play's importance as a context and medium for development during the early years (Zigler & Bishop-Josef, 2004).
Even though play in the history of ECE has been viewed favorably as a cornerstone of learning (e.g., Froebel, 1887/1896; Pestalozzi, 1894/1915; Piaget, 1970; Vygotsky, 1978), there have always been its critics who advocate for more structured and direct instruction. Recently, however, the debate has intensified in an educational context strongly influenced by early learning standards and assessment of academic attainments (Christie & Roskos, 2007). Greater concern exists that play in ECE is slipping away and that a vigorous response is now needed to protect its important role (Miller & Almon, 2009). Three ways to make such response are to employ contemporary scholarship to better explain: (a) the nature of play, (b) the importance of play, and (c) play pedagogy.
The Nature of Play
Various attempts have been made over the years to understand play and its role in ECE, and these have assumed great importance in efforts to improve play's status in the field and in the public eye. For example, DeVries (2001) recommended that much of what children do in ECE classrooms should be called “work activities,” which would include construction, exploring, investigating, problem-solving, and experimenting. Pretending and group games remain play forms. She recommended that teachers include in the curriculum high quality, intellectually challenging projects that stimulate social, emotional, moral, and intellectual development. Also for Elkind (2001), play is not the same as work in ECE. The confusion concerning play and work to some degree may be attributed to Maria Montessori (1912/1964, p. 53), who said that play is the child's work. Play is not work, nor is it the opposite of work.
Elkind sought to correct this misunderstanding by advancing the Piagetian view that play and work are complementary, two poles of an adaption process which requires both assimilation (play) and accommodation (work). Exploration and imitation, including exploratory play and imitative play, are more accommodative or stimulus-oriented. Play is more response-oriented, where personal meaning is more important than adjusting to external realty. Typically, a child's behaviors can be described as a mixture or a sequencing of “work” and “play,” but the two states should not be lumped together or viewed as opposites. Play and work function together in serving the child in adapting to and learning from experiences. ECE activities for children have structure with degrees of play and work. Hardly ever would one label something that a child does as pure work or pure play.
Since ECE is concerned with the development of young children, a question to answer is how play can be a positive influence. To answer this question demands that play be appreciated as a complex and highly differentiated phenomenon. With its definition problematic, teachers and researchers often have used an additive model in which the following criteria are considered when judging whether play is occurring: (a) nonliterality, (b) positive affect, (c) process over product orientation, (d) intrinsic motivation, and (e) free choice. Applying these can help distinguish play from work, routines, rituals, and play-related behaviors like exploration and imitation (Johnson, Christie, & Wardle, 2005).
Analysis of play is made on the basis of what is known about contexts, children's actions, and their inferred mental states. A useful distinction to make is between play frame or context (surrounding the play episode) and play script or text (within the play episode). The ECE teacher or researcher can keep separate metaplay negotiations or play disruptions (e.g., teacher intrusions or children's conflicts) which snap the play frame, from enactments occurring during play episodes. Observing and understanding play requires recognizing its multilayered qualities and synthesizing information about person, object, space, time, and situational factors.
Play enactments can be coded with respect to levels or forms exhibited. Many systems have been used in research and teaching. Prominent exemplars include Parten (1932) for level of social participation during play (e.g., solitary, parallel, associative, cooperative, onlooker, unoccupied); and for cognitive forms of play there are Piaget's (1962) sensorimotor, symbolic, and games with rules and Smilansky's (1968) functional, constructive, dramatic, and sociodramatic play. Cross-walking level of social play and type of cognitive play is common, having been first introduced by Rubin, Maioni, and Hornung (1976). In addition to classification, play behaviors of young children can be evaluated. As an early example, Smilansky (1968) used two criteria for crediting more mature sociodramatic play in relation to dramatic play: social interaction and verbal communication. Both dramatic play and sociodramatic play included role-play with respect to self and others, object and situation transformations, and persistence (at least 10 minutes). More recently, Bodrova (2008) discussed evaluating mature versus immature play using criteria such as: (a) ability to sustain a specific role by consistently engaging in actions, speech, and interactions that fit the character enacted; (b) ability to use substitute or pretend objects; (c) ability to follow rules associated with the make-believe scenario; and (d) ability to integrate many themes and ideas and sustain play over time spans of several days or weeks. Immature play is repetitive, dependent on concrete props, lacking in role enactment, including the presence of peer conflicts, not following implicit or explicit play rules, and simple or unelaborated content in play episodes of short duration. Schemes are used to score levels of other specific play forms, such as constructive block play (Forman, 1982).
Play evaluation is needed to gauge what children are doing so that teachers can then guide them toward more mature, developmentally enriching play. Descriptions of play need to retain action sequences and contextual information. Deliberate attention must be paid to children's goals, means for reaching them, and their understanding. With careful observations of play the teacher is better prepared for deciding on appropriate interventions (Johnson et al., 2005; Van Hoorn, Nourot, Scales, & Alward, 2010).
Importance of Play
The significance of play in ECE is recognized internationally and testimonies to its place in young children's development and well-being are based on considerable theoretical and empirical evidence as well as teacher lore and ideology (e.g., Dockett & Fleer, 1999; Johnson et al., 2005; Pellegrini, 2009; Wood & Attfield, 2005). Teachers’ and parents' funds of knowledge about play and their skill in performing various adult roles to foster mature play are important factors in efforts to promote school readiness and continued learning in young children through providing them with effective play-based ECE curriculum and instruction. Teacher and parent beliefs about play and its importance have been studied over the years (e.g., Bennett, Wood, & Rogers, 1997; Fisher, Hirsh-Pasek, Golinkoff, & Gryfe, 2008; Kemple, 1996).
According to the neo-Vygotskian cultural-historical approach, as represented by Leont'ev (1981), pretend play is the “leading activity” in child development during the first five years (the most important activity psychologically but not the most common), but schoolwork is the leading activity for 5- to 10-year-old children (middle childhood). Hence, play and play pedagogy for the two age groups are similar but also fit differently into the child's development and learning over the range of years of ECE (birth to 8 years old). Contemporary research supports the importance of play during the early years in numerous areas of growth and development including: (a) self-regulation, social competence, and early academics; (b) physical well-being and fitness; and (c) problem-solving and creativity.
Self-Regulation, Social Competence, and Early Academics
Self-regulation is an executive function process of exercising control over one's emotions, cognitions, impulses, and actions. Mature play entails self-regulation in that it is purposeful and requires inhibition of inappropriate responses, the regulation of attention, and working memory in the service of organizing, sequencing, switching, and planning behaviors. Another component of self-regulation is theory of mind (e.g., perspective taking, emotional understanding). Vygotsky (1978) argues that play can help develop self-regulation when children create an imaginary situation, take on and act out roles, and follow rules implicit in the play scenario. Although mature role play has received a great deal of attention as a means of developing self-regulation (Bodrova, 2008), other play forms including games, constructive play, and physical play share this potential (Bodrova & Leong, 2007; Riley, San Juan, Klinkner, & Ramminger, 2008). Both social competence and early learning of academic content hinge upon the ability to be focused and maintain self-control, which themselves are strengthened by mature play.
Active experiencing found in good play stimulates the maturation of executive function occurring in the prefrontal cortex of the brain (Diamond, Barnett, Thomas, & Munro, 2007). Play can foster a sense of control and self-regulation of one's own learning. During play children set their own challenges and determine their own attention and plans. These cognitive mechanisms can contribute to effortful, intentional use of imagination, creativity, and problem solving. Children create their own zone of proximal development and are self-scaffolded in play; during play children transcend the concrete here and now and use abstract thought and build symbolic competence (Vygotsky, 1978). Recent research has documented relations among play, self-regulation, and executive function in young children.
For example, Whitebread (2010) found that self-regulatory skills could be facilitated in 3- to 5-year old children through a variety of playful activities designed by 32 teachers in England. These activities included constructing a model, dressing a doll, and playing board and card games, either with peers or adults. Behaviors were rated as higher in metacognitive or self-regulatory quality when they happened in a social context characterized by extensive collaboration and talk. Analysis of 582 play episodes showed that adult questioning had a slight positive impact on what children could say about their own learning, but this greatly depressed children's self-regulation and motivation. Supporting play in educational settings to achieve self-regulation requires a mix of adult emotional support, children's initiation and feelings of control, cognitive challenges in the play activities, and private speech and collaborative talk to bring about learning and metacognitive awareness. In an important study, Diamond et al. (2007) tested 147 prekindergarteners in state funded programs and found that the Tools of the Mind curriculum, based on 40 activities that promoted executive functioning (including mature dramatic play), led to improved cognitive control at the end of the second year of the program on the Dots and Flanker tasks, Stroop-type measures of executive function (see Diamond et al., 2007 for task descriptions).
Social competence includes ability and willingness to engage in socially responsible behavior as well as in positive social play with peers. Both involve emotional regulation and perspective taking. Elias and Berk (2002) found that middle class 3- and 4-year-olds who engaged in more mature sociodramatic play were more cooperative during circle and clean-up times than were children with lower scores on the play measures, controlling for verbal ability and initial self-control scores. High impulse children as scored at the beginning of the school year, who engaged in complex sociodramatic play, improved the most in clean-up performance over the course of the year.
Peer interactions in open-ended play also benefit social skill learning, cooperation, and building confidence in dealing with other children. Broadhead, Howard, and Wood (2010) reported that when play is thematically driven by young children and they are able to follow their own interests and plans there is more cooperation, rich language use, problem-solving, and reciprocity. Her Social Play Continuum tool is used by teachers and researchers to quantify but also locate and reflect upon peer play in the associative, social, highly social, and cooperative domains. Broadhead et al. also employed teacher-initiated and teacher-directed activities where children are shown that their play is valued. For example, if less mature social play is performed by older children, the teacher would wait until after the play is finished before engaging in discussions with them about it. This collaborative approach to play observation, intervention, and reflection aims to help teachers create a more harmonious classroom atmosphere where quality play can flourish. This sensitive child-centered approach to social play and building and respecting classroom community is similar to Rogers and Evans (2008) who used child focus groups to capture an insider's view of role-play. Child initiated and adult guided play aims to build self-regulation and social-emotional competence; mature play which is related to these two important attributes is viewed as a means to prepare children for academic achievement.
Play that strengthens self-regulation and increases social competence in young children helps them in attaining school readiness and subsequent classroom success. Play of this kind is important because it makes it more likely that children with this play background will be able to demonstrate social and emotional skills necessary for performing the student role. Taking turns, following directions, and other basics of school life depend on having these general skills. Play also is valuable during the preschool years for its benefits to emerging literacy and numeracy, and helping children do well in these high intensity academic areas (Hirsh-Pasek, Golinkoff, Berk, & Singer, 2009).
Research over past decades supports the importance of mature play for language and early learning (Christie, 2010; Roskos & Christie, 2004). Literacy rests on language and representational or symbolic competence in general. Play benefits these foundations as well as early literacy in the areas of alphabet knowledge, concepts about print, oral language, and comprehension, and phonological awareness. Roskos and Christie (2004) reviewed considerable research on the topic and concluded that play promotes literacy because play uses language and symbols and aids in children's making connections between oral and written media. As an example from many studies that could be mentioned, Dickinson and Tabors (2001) followed 74 low-income family 3-year olds over several years, and reported significant associations between children's talk during play and their later literacy scores. Note also that the play pedagogy techniques described later in this chapter, such as Paley's narrative approach, attest to and capitalize on the close affinity among play, stories, and literacy.
The play-math connection is a second critical area that has caught researchers’ attention in recent years. Young children encounter many opportunities to acquire knowledge and develop math skills in their everyday activities, including their play. Ginsburg (2006) noted the potential for reading and book use to help children learn about perspectives, angles, covariation (e.g., the Three Bears and their bed sizes corresponding to their body sizes), numbers, and so forth. Block play invites considerable opportunities to develop spatial knowledge; play with small objects encourages counting, patterning, and grouping. Ginsberg's Everyday Math curriculum is developmentally appropriate with use of materials and physical actions, and balances play with more direct instruction. When teaching is not play per se, it can at least be playful.
Numerous other studies indicate support for the relation of play with emerging spatial and quantitative concepts in young children. Again, spontaneous child initiated play and adult guided play are shown to be valuable. Ness and Farenga (2007) cover a broad range of topics concerned with spatial concepts, including architecture. Gelman (2006) showed the motivating power of play; children learn and use math skills when they are embedded in a game more than when they are not. Ramani and Siegler (2008) showed that a relatively brief intervention with at risk preschoolers using the game “Chutes & Ladders” promoted their number line estimation ability, knowing the numerals, counting, and quantity. Worthington (2010) reported that during play young children invent math symbols and develop their imaginations and mathematical graphics, such as gestures to stand for the “take away” sign.
Physical Well-Being and Fitness
Play is an essential part of physical development and it helps to develop active and healthy bodies especially important in fighting against the obesity epidemic. According to a report from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC, 2009), obesity prevalence among low-income, preschool children has increased gradually from 12.4% in 1998 to 14.5% in 2003 and to 14.6% in 2008. In a longitudinal study, Taylor et al. (2009) described patterns of physical activity and inactivity of 3-, 4-, and 5-year-old children. They reported an increase in screen time and a decrease in physical activity, especially for 4- and 5-year-olds. Another recent study investigated physical activity of young children and playtime practices and policies in 96 childcare centers in North Carolina. The results of the study showed that few best practice guidelines were followed by a majority of the participating centers. Only 13.7% of childcare centers in North Carolina offered 120 minutes of active playtime during the school day (McWilliams et al., 2009).
Through play and exploration of the environment, children practice physical skills such as running, jumping, hopping, skipping, and galloping. By exploring and experimenting with the movement capabilities of their bodies, young children start to be aware of their personal spaces in relation to other persons’ spaces; and children begin to gain more control over their bodies (Gallahue & Ozmun, 1998). Activities such as pulling, pushing, swinging, and hanging help children to develop their upper bodies; and their lower bodies develop through jumping, skipping, galloping, and hopping. These fundamental movement skills also improve children's body awareness (Sanders, 2002). Moreover, they have to be mastered before learning more complex specialized skills necessary for play relating to games, sports, and dance activities (Gallahue & Ozmun, 1998). For example, earlier appearing play that involves throwing and catching will contribute to later passing and shooting skills in basketball. Therefore, children exhibiting physical skills at an early age are more likely in the future to be active and participate in sports (Cliff, Okely, & McKeen, 2009).
Outdoor Play
The benefits of outdoor play on children's physical, cognitive, and social-emotional development is well known. Children who spend their time outdoors show superior gross motor skills, longer spans of concentration, and better language and collaborative skills (Fjortoft, 2001). According to Clements (2004), outdoor play helps children to develop a sense of community while enjoying sensory experiences with dirt, water, sand, and mud. Similarly, Rivkin (1995) highlighted the value of playing outdoors. She noted that when playing outdoors children experience “sensory qualities of the world” and can also experiment with “big behaviors” such as shouting, running, climbing, and jumping. Being outdoors also improves children's attention levels. For instances, Martensson et al. (2009) investigated the restorative potential of green outdoor environments for children in preschool settings. Results showed that having available areas surrounded with large trees, bushes, and hilly landscapes, reduced children's inattention. Besides nature, landscaping elements can add value to children's outdoor play. Greening the school grounds makes children more active and increases their play repertories; green school grounds invite children to jump, climb, dig, and lift (Dyment & Bell, 2007).
Allowing for a variety of physical actions during outdoor play is important for promoting preschoolers’ participation in moderate to vigorous physical activities. In their current research, Aarts, Wendel, Oers, Goor, and Schuit (2010) defined outdoor play as a “cheap and natural way for children to be physically active.” They investigated the environmental determinants of outdoor play in children. Their results showed that to be physically active children needed adequate space, diverse play opportunities, and interaction with natural elements on the school grounds. They also found that children were more active when rules, policies, and supervision allowed for noncompetitive, open-ended play, and when opportunities were present to care for the garden and other green spaces (Aarts et al., 2010).
Creative Expression
Friedrich Froebel (1887/1896) emphasized play and its use of gifts (play materials) and occupations (activities). He believed that humans are essentially productive and creative, and that fulfillment comes through developing these elements in harmony with God and the world. As a result, Froebel sought to encourage the creation of educational environments that involved practical work and the direct use of materials. Through engaging with the world, understanding unfolds, hence the significance of play understood as a creative activity through which children become aware of their place in the world. Piaget (1962) and Vygotsky (1978) also viewed children as active explorers of their world. Play is therefore an important part of the process of constructing knowledge. It enables children to control what happens, and to use what they already know to further their understanding and development (Olsen & Sumsion, 2000).
Children learn best in an environment that permits discovery, curiosity, exploration, imagination, and play. Play is closely attached to the child's physical, social, emotional, and cognitive growth (Mayesky, 2009). Research suggests that children in their pretend play perform transformational operations that may be linked with creative thought (Mellou, 1995). The use of imagination in pretend play is a form of creativity according to several authors (Russ, 1993; Russ, Robins, & Christiano, 1999; Singer & Singer, 1990). In addition, constructive play is creative in that it can be open-ended play with multiple outcomes. Play expression varies and is more likely to approach being creative when conditions for it are free, spontaneous, and unstructured with many possible outcomes. Such play encourages creative thinking and sparks imagination (Ackermann, Gauntlrtt, & Weckstrom, 2009).
However, such an outcome is not automatic. Celebi-Oncu and Unluer (2010) examined creativity in children's play and use of play materials. Results showed that most of the children were not able to express creativity with different kinds of play materials; in their play children greatly preferred to use toys as play materials. In a second study Celebi-Oncu and Unluer (2010) found that most of the children were not able to use real objects creatively as play materials. Teachers have to encourage their students to play freely with different unstructured materials in different areas and situations. Play enables children to generate a range of creative behaviors in a low cost manner, especially after they have sampled the environment surrounding them; a range of creative behaviors that might be adaptive to their specific function (Pellegrini, Dupuis, & Smith, 2006).
Encouraging reusable, discarded, and open-ended materials brings the old-fashioned play back on track, which actually helps foster creativity with its components, such as playfulness, humor, curiosity, flexibility, and originality. It is fun without a set of specific goals or predetermined outcomes. As Almon (2003) exclaimed, working with open-ended materials is particularly effective as children attempt to solve problems. Open-ended materials encourage creative and divergent thinking. There is no right or wrong way to use these materials. Children can take risks and develop confidence. Each time they use these materials, they are creating something new.
Creative play does not require expensive and fancy materials to flourish. Research suggests that even in the poorest country in the world, children were capable of playing creatively despite their poverty. A study by Berinstein and Magalhaes (2009) aimed to gain an understanding of the essence of play experience for children in Zanzibar, the poorest country in the world. They found that play experience in Zanzibar had aspects of creativity and resourcefulness. What does this finding tell Western countries? Should this be an opportunity for rethinking play? Children are born with creative potential. They observe the world and react to it using their imagination. Simple material play can prop up their imagination and enhance their creative play from within. A great example of using reusable, discarded, and open-ended materials is REMIDA the creative recycling center in Reggio Emilia, Italy. Here discarded materials become resources and here unsold or rejected stock from shops is collected so that they can be reused for a different purpose. REMIDA is where you can make the most of waste materials, using them to create a new product that shows respect for the environment (Ferrari, 2005). When we consider the global economy today, REMIDA is a great way to foster creativity at a cost of next to nothing.
Reggio teaches that the best environment encourages a layered web of relationships to develop and grow (Cadwell, 1997). This web includes relations with things. Cobb (1998) states that “in childhood, the cognitive process is essentially poetic… it is a sensory integration of self and environment” (p. 89). Cobb emphasizes that children need to develop a relationship with materials from nature and those that are man-made, to shape small worlds of their own, and to enrich their imaginations.
In sum, a great deal of research supports the value of play for learning and development across different domains during the early years. An important challenge in ECE curriculum and instruction is to create appropriate and effective ways to harness play's potential in the design of programs and activities.
