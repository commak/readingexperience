			<p class="title">PLAY IN EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION<br></p><p class="author">James E. Johnson, Serap Sevimli-Celik, Monirah Al-Mansour</p>

Play in early childhood education (ECE) is a very broad topic that continues to generate much discussion and debate. Slogans such as “play is the business of childhood” or “play is the child's way of learning” are still heard but they are becoming less convincing. Voicing slogans such as these often encourages those who are opposed to play in education to dismiss it on the grounds that the idea seems too broad and vague to be a valid and useful basis for teaching and learning. It doesn't help when ECE programs claiming to be play-centered lack a thoughtful rationale for their play policies and practices or when low-level, unchallenging activities called “play” abound in their indoor and outdoor environments. This threatens the place of play in the ECE by inviting misguided attacks on it and by encouraging educators to devalue play's importance as a context and medium for development during the early years (Zigler & Bishop-Josef, 2004).

Various attempts have been made over the years to understand play and its role in ECE, and these have assumed great importance in efforts to improve play's status in the field and in the public eye. For example, DeVries (2001) recommended that much of what children do in ECE classrooms should be called “work activities,” which would include construction, exploring, investigating, problem-solving, and experimenting. Pretending and group games remain play forms. She recommended that teachers include in the curriculum high quality, intellectually challenging projects that stimulate social, emotional, moral, and intellectual development. Also for Elkind (2001), play is not the same as work in ECE. The confusion concerning play and work to some degree may be attributed to Maria Montessori (1912/1964, p. 53), who said that play is the child's work. Play is not work, nor is it the opposite of work.
Typically, a child's behaviors can be described as a mixture or a sequencing of “work” and “play,” but the two states should not be lumped together or viewed as opposites. Play and work function together in serving the child in adapting to and learning from experiences. ECE activities for children have structure with degrees of play and work. Hardly ever would one label something that a child does as pure work or pure play.
</p>
	<p class="text1">
The significance of play in ECE is recognized internationally and testimonies to its place in young children's development and well-being are based on considerable theoretical and empirical evidence as well as teacher lore and ideology (e.g., Dockett & Fleer, 1999; Johnson et al., 2005; Pellegrini, 2009; Wood & Attfield, 2005). Teachers’ and parents' funds of knowledge about play and their skill in performing various adult roles to foster mature play are important factors in efforts to promote school readiness and continued learning in young children through providing them with effective play-based ECE curriculum and instruction. Teacher and parent beliefs about play and its importance have been studied over the years (e.g., Bennett, Wood, & Rogers, 1997; Fisher, Hirsh-Pasek, Golinkoff, & Gryfe, 2008; Kemple, 1996).
According to the neo-Vygotskian cultural-historical approach, as represented by Leont'ev (1981), pretend play is the “leading activity” in child development during the first five years (the most important activity psychologically but not the most common), but schoolwork is the leading activity for 5- to 10-year-old children (middle childhood). Hence, play and play pedagogy for the two age groups are similar but also fit differently into the child's development and learning over the range of years of ECE (birth to 8 years old). Contemporary research supports the importance of play during the early years in numerous areas of growth and development including: (a) self-regulation, social competence, and early academics; physical well-being and fitness; and problem-solving and creativity.

Self-regulation is an executive function process of exercising control over one's emotions, cognitions, impulses, and actions. Mature play entails self-regulation in that it is purposeful and requires inhibition of inappropriate responses, the regulation of attention, and working memory in the service of organizing, sequencing, switching, and planning behaviors. Another component of self-regulation is theory of mind (e.g., perspective taking, emotional understanding).<strong> Vygotsky </strong> (1978) argues that play can help develop self-regulation when children create an imaginary situation, take on and act out roles, and follow rules implicit in the play scenario. Although mature role play has received a great deal of attention as a means of developing self-regulation (Bodrova, 2008), other play forms including games, constructive play, and physical play share this potential (Bodrova & Leong, 2007; Riley, San Juan, Klinkner, & Ramminger, 2008). Both social competence and early learning of academic content hinge upon the ability to be focused and maintain self-control, which themselves are strengthened by mature play.

Active experiencing found in good play stimulates the maturation of executive function occurring in the prefrontal cortex of the brain (Diamond, Barnett, Thomas, & Munro, 2007). Play can foster a sense of control and self-regulation of one's own learning. During play children set their own challenges and determine their own attention and plans. These cognitive mechanisms can contribute to effortful, intentional use of imagination, creativity, and problem solving. Children create their own zone of proximal development and are self-scaffolded in play; during play children transcend the concrete here and now and use abstract thought and build symbolic competence (Vygotsky, 1978). Supporting play in educational settings to achieve self-regulation requires a mix of adult emotional support, children's initiation and feelings of control, cognitive challenges in the play activities, and private speech and collaborative talk to bring about learning and metacognitive awareness.

Social competence includes ability and willingness to engage in socially responsible behavior as well as in positive social play with peers. Both involve emotional regulation and perspective taking. Broadhead, Howard, and Wood (2010) reported that when play is thematically driven by young children and they are able to follow their own interests and plans there is more cooperation, rich language use, problem-solving, and reciprocity. Her <strong> Social Play Continuum </strong>tool is used by teachers and researchers to quantify but also locate and reflect upon peer play in the associative, social, highly social, and cooperative domains. Broadhead et al. also employed teacher-initiated and teacher-directed activities where children are shown that their play is valued. For example, if less mature social play is performed by older children, the teacher would wait until after the play is finished before engaging in discussions with them about it. This collaborative approach to play observation, intervention, and reflection aims to help teachers create a more harmonious classroom atmosphere where quality play can flourish. This sensitive child-centered approach to social play and building and respecting classroom community is similar to Rogers and Evans (2008) who used child focus groups to capture an insider's view of role-play. Child initiated and adult guided play aims to build self-regulation and social-emotional competence; mature play which is related to these two important attributes is viewed as a means to prepare children for academic achievement.

Play that strengthens self-regulation and increases social competence in young children helps them in attaining school readiness and subsequent classroom success. Play of this kind is important because it makes it more likely that children with this play background will be able to demonstrate social and emotional skills necessary for performing the student role. Taking turns, following directions, and other basics of school life depend on having these general skills. Play also is valuable during the preschool years for its benefits to emerging literacy and numeracy, and helping children do well in these high intensity academic areas (Hirsh-Pasek, Golinkoff, Berk, & Singer, 2009).

Research over past decades supports the importance of mature play for language and early learning (Christie, 2010; Roskos & Christie, 2004). Literacy rests on language and representational or symbolic competence in general. Play benefits these foundations as well as early literacy in the areas of alphabet knowledge, concepts about print, oral language, and comprehension, and phonological awareness. Roskos and Christie (2004) reviewed considerable research on the topic and concluded that play promotes literacy because play uses language and symbols and aids in children's making connections between oral and written media. As an example from many studies that could be mentioned, Dickinson and Tabors (2001) followed 74 low-income family 3-year olds over several years, and reported significant associations between children's talk during play and their later literacy scores. Note also that the play pedagogy techniques described later in this chapter, such as Paley's narrative approach, attest to and capitalize on the close affinity among play, stories, and literacy.

The play-math connection is a second critical area that has caught researchers’ attention in recent years. Young children encounter many opportunities to acquire knowledge and develop math skills in their everyday activities, including their play. Ginsburg (2006) noted the potential for reading and book use to help children learn about perspectives, angles, covariation (e.g., the Three Bears and their bed sizes corresponding to their body sizes), numbers, and so forth. Block play invites considerable opportunities to develop spatial knowledge; play with small objects encourages counting, patterning, and grouping. Ginsberg's Everyday Math curriculum is developmentally appropriate with use of materials and physical actions, and balances play with more direct instruction. When teaching is not play per se, it can at least be playful.

Numerous other studies indicate support for the relation of play with emerging spatial and quantitative concepts in young children. Again, spontaneous child initiated play and adult guided play are shown to be valuable. Ness and Farenga (2007) cover a broad range of topics concerned with spatial concepts, including architecture. Gelman (2006) showed the motivating power of play; children learn and use math skills when they are embedded in a game more than when they are not. Ramani and Siegler (2008) showed that a relatively brief intervention with at risk preschoolers using the game “Chutes & Ladders” promoted their number line estimation ability, knowing the numerals, counting, and quantity. Worthington (2010) reported that during play young children invent math symbols and develop their imaginations and mathematical graphics, such as gestures to stand for the “take away” sign.

Play is an essential part of physical development and it helps to develop active and healthy bodies especially important in fighting against the obesity epidemic. According to a report from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC, 2009), obesity prevalence among low-income, preschool children has increased gradually from 12.4% in 1998 to 14.5% in 2003 and to 14.6% in 2008. In a longitudinal study, Taylor et al. (2009) described patterns of physical activity and inactivity of 3-, 4-, and 5-year-old children. They reported an increase in screen time and a decrease in physical activity, especially for 4- and 5-year-olds. Another recent study investigated physical activity of young children and playtime practices and policies in 96 childcare centers in North Carolina. The results of the study showed that few best practice guidelines were followed by a majority of the participating centers. Only 13.7% of childcare centers in North Carolina offered 120 minutes of active playtime during the school day (McWilliams et al., 2009).

Through play and exploration of the environment, children practice physical skills such as running, jumping, hopping, skipping, and galloping. By exploring and experimenting with the movement capabilities of their bodies, young children start to be aware of their personal spaces in relation to other persons’ spaces; and children begin to gain more control over their bodies (Gallahue & Ozmun, 1998). Activities such as pulling, pushing, swinging, and hanging help children to develop their upper bodies; and their lower bodies develop through jumping, skipping, galloping, and hopping. These fundamental movement skills also improve children's body awareness (Sanders, 2002). Moreover, they have to be mastered before learning more complex specialized skills necessary for play relating to games, sports, and dance activities (Gallahue & Ozmun, 1998). For example, earlier appearing play that involves throwing and catching will contribute to later passing and shooting skills in basketball. Therefore, children exhibiting physical skills at an early age are more likely in the future to be active and participate in sports (Cliff, Okely, & McKeen, 2009).

The benefits of outdoor play on children's physical, cognitive, and social-emotional development is well known. Children who spend their time outdoors show superior gross motor skills, longer spans of concentration, and better language and collaborative skills (Fjortoft, 2001). According to Clements (2004), outdoor play helps children to develop a sense of community while enjoying sensory experiences with dirt, water, sand, and mud. Allowing for a variety of physical actions during outdoor play is important for promoting preschoolers’ participation in moderate to vigorous physical activities.

Encouraging reusable, discarded, and open-ended materials brings the old-fashioned play back on track, which actually helps foster creativity with its components, such as playfulness, humor, curiosity, flexibility, and originality. It is fun without a set of specific goals or predetermined outcomes. Open-ended materials encourage creative and divergent thinking. There is no right or wrong way to use these materials. Children can take risks and develop confidence. Each time they use these materials, they are creating something new.
Creative play does not require expensive and fancy materials to flourish. Research suggests that even in the poorest country in the world, children were capable of playing creatively despite their poverty. Should this be an opportunity for rethinking play? Children are born with creative potential. They observe the world and react to it using their imagination. Simple material play can prop up their imagination and enhance their creative play from within. 
</p>
	<p class="text1">
In sum, a great deal of research supports the value of play for learning and development across different domains during the early years. An important challenge in ECE curriculum and instruction is to create appropriate and effective ways to harness play's potential in the design of programs and activities.
