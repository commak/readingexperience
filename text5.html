The distinction between “child” and “adult” is made in every society and the practice of treating children differently than adults is universal, although the nature and scope of this practice varies significantly from culture to culture. Studies of the phenomenon known as childhood, the development of children, the social role of the child, and the varying ways in which societies treat and justify their treatment of children are an important part of psychology, social psychology, sociology, history, and anthropology.

In the history of ethics, references to children are infrequent and usually appear as subsidiary parts of discussions of moral development, virtue, moral education, moral responsibility, the ascription of rights and duties,personal relationships, and the family. With respect to virtue, both <strong> Plato </strong> (c. 430-347 B.C.E.) and Aristotle (384-322 B.C.E.) raised the questions “What kind of person shall we raise our children to be, and how are we to accomplish this?” because they were both convinced that the cultivation of virtuous traits of character is one of the primary functions of morality. Plato defended the notion that the education of children is primarily a matter of the training of character rather than the acquisition of information and skills. With respect to the acquisition of good character, Aristotle argued that children must acquire not merely the right moral beliefs but they must come to possess the desire and the will to put these beliefs into practice, and this can be attained only through virtuous conduct. Hence, he argued against the Socratic thesis that virtue is knowledge, that is, that knowledge of virtue is sufficient to produce virtuous action.
Concerns about moral education are also to be found in the writings of Anselm (1033-1109), Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712-1778), John Locke (1632-1704), and Immanuel Kant (1724-1804).

During the Hellenistic period, the ancient Stoics disputed the Epicurean account of the way that children developed into adults motivated by universal moral principles. These disputes are called “cradle arguments,” and they were quite common in Hellenistic ethics. Cicero (106-43 B.C.E.), for example, argued against the Epicureans that it is love of self, not pleasure, which supplies the infant's primary impulse to action. Through a psychological process which the ancient Stoics called oikeiosis, (endearment, attachment) the infant's interest in and affection for things that serve her self-interest eventually become the child's interest in and affection for such things independent of whether they serve those impulses, which eventually will become an affection for morally appropriate behavior. Among the modern philosophers, <strong> John Stuart Mill </strong>(1806-1873) endorsed the Epicurean position that a child's original desire of or motive to virtue is its conduciveness to pleasure. Rousseau took no position on this dispute, although he endorsed the idea, implicit in the Stoic account, that children pass through several age-related stages in their moral development.

Philosophical discussions of the nature of moral responsibility refer to children in the attempt to develop theories about the mental conditions necessary for holding persons morally blameworthy. For example, Jeremy Bentham (1748-1832) contended that since infants have “not yet attained that state or disposition of mind” in which “the whispers of simple morality” will influence their future conduct, we ought not to blame them for their untoward behavior. Concerns about the mental capacity of children also arise in discussions about the ascription of moral rights. Writers such as Locke, Mill, and John RAWLS have tied the justification for denying to children so-called liberty rights (the right to freedom from the interference of others in making choices that affect only oneself) to their lack of reason or to the immaturity of their mental faculties. Others such as <strong> Herbert Spencer </strong>(1820-1903) countered that all persons should have complete freedom to exercise whatever faculties they possess. The fact that children are intellectually immature means only that they have faculties that are less mature than those of an adult; it does not entail that their liberty right to exercise those faculties is or should be restricted.

Most of the pre—twentieth-century philosophical discussions of children have been about their role in the family. In marked contrast to recent philosophical concerns about children, the central question was not about their rights but about the nature and scope of their (filial) duties: What obligations do children have toward their parents and how do these obligations arisé Thomas Aquinas (1225?-1274) contended that children owe gratitude to their parents because their parents give them nurture and protection.<strong> Thomas Hobbes  </strong>(1588-1679) claims that a child's duty is obedience because the child has tacitly agreed to obey the parents out of fear of being killed or abandoned by them. Later writers appear to accept the position that the child's duty to the parent is obedience, but they disagree that this is grounded on a contract or an agreement between parent and child. Thus, Locke traces filial obligation to the parents’ right to govern their children. Rousseau grounds filial obligation on the fact that it is necessary for children to obey their parents if they are to survive their minority.

Although references to children sometimes occur in the context of discussions of particular topics (e.g., moral responsibility), those who have proposed ethical theories have, by and large, ignored children. Philosophical claims about those persons who have obligations toward others and those persons toward whom one has obligations have usually been restricted to adults and to strangers. This is unfortunate because facts about children and parental love may be relevant to the content and application of those ethical principles that comprise the theory. For example, Locke argues that a fundamental principle of obligation is to refrain from doing those acts that would violate the natural rights of others. However, the “others” that Locke has in mind are adults, not children, and the “natural rights” are usually assumed to be the “negative” rights to noninterference in their life, liberty, or property. Suppose, however, that children are included in the class of those who have natural rights. Then there seems to be a strong argument for including at least some “positive” rights to protection and care in the list of rights. If one does not include these rights, then the theory has the counterintuitive result that an unwed mother whose unplanned and unwanted baby has died of starvation because of her neglect has done nothing morally wrong so long as she can show that she has neither promised to feed, clothe, or shelter this particular infant, nor interfered with its “attempts” to acquire its own food or shelter. On the other hand, if one does include positive rights among the list of natural rights, then either adults have the same rights to protection and care as those accorded to children, or an argument must be produced to show why adults are to be accorded only negative rights.

Parental love for their children also poses a difficulty for ethical theory. A recurring theme of Western ethics is that morality requires us to be impartial. Thus, John Stuart Mill urged that, when weighing the interests of different people, we should be “as strictly impartial as a disinterested and benevolent spectator.” But this idea conflicts with parental love. Parental love is not only thoroughly partial, but most people think that partiality toward one's child is a parent's moral duty.
In addition to the preceding, the most compelling philosophical problems that arise when ethicists take children into account when developing their theories are these:
The nature of childhood. What do we mean by the concept of “child”? When philosophers raise this question, their interest is usually in the normative, not the conventional use of the term. Their question is: “What is a child for the purpose of ascribing rights and duties?” not “What is a child according to custom or legal tradition?” Answers to the former question have varied. Mill said that children are human beings who are not “in the maturity of their faculties,” and are “still in a state to require being taken care of by others.” Others have emphasized the child's lack of capacity to make rational decisions and the ability to be self-sufficient (Kant). This raises several secondary questions: What is rationality, maturity, self-sufficiency? How relevant are these capacities to the ascription of rights and duties? Is there any correspondence between the conventional concept of children, based on chronological age, and the normative concept suggested by the philosopher? What is the extent of childhood (how long does it last)? What is the significance of the differences that are found in the qualities that are attributed to the child and to the adult?
Do children have moral rights? This question is a logically “closed” question if one means by the term “child” one who lacks the capacity to have moral rights. However, few seem to have gone so far as to suggest that children have no moral rights at all, including, e.g., the right not to be injured or killed, although some have suggested that newborns may lack this right (because they are not capable of having an interest in their own future existence), and thus infanticide is morally justifiable.

What legal liberty rights should be extended to children? Most of the contemporary philosophers who have discussed children's rights have been particularly interested in the legal right to liberty, that is, the right to noninterference by others with one's self-regarding behavior. “Liberationists” are those who argue that children should have all the rights that adults currently possess, for example, the right to vote, to work, to own property, to choose one's own guardian, to make sexual choices. “Caretakers,” on the other hand, are those who would deny children these rights. Leaving aside the preceding question about the normative definition of childhood, when one enters the debate between liberationists and caretakers, it is important to determine whether competence can be correlated with particular age-groups. The remaining questions are: What (if any) are the mental capacities necessary to the possession of liberty rights? Assuming that one can possess more or less of a particular mental capacity, then how much of that capacity is required to possess the liberty right? Shall we distinguish between particular liberty rights (e.g., the right to play with a toy, to play in the street, to work) and say that some of them but not others are predicated on the possession of particular mental capacities? Should competence always be required of a right holder (if I am not competent to do something, e.g., tie my shoes, should I be denied the right to do it)?

The paradox of self-determination. One of the rights that some writers have argued that children possess is the right to have their future options kept open until they are fully formed adults capable of deciding among them. But this presents a vicious regress. It is said that those persons who are fully autonomous are those who have shaped their own lives and character. This in turn implies that they already are capable of determining their own life. It seems impossible for them to have this capacity on their own, for they would have had to have a fully formed self to do that, and so on ad infinitum. Is there a way to break this regress? Second, if there is a right of self-determination that children have or will come to possess, then what constraints does this place on how their parents can treat them now?

Grown children and filial duties. Do grown children owe anything to their elderly parents? Some philosophers have argued that grown children owe their parents honor and respect because their parents have reared them to adulthood. Others argue that grown children owe nothing to their parents because child-rearing is not a favor but a voluntary sacrifice of time and money for the child's benefit. A parent's voluntary sacrifice for her child does not make him indebted, although it may provide the ground for a future friendship between them.
</p>
	<p class="text1">
Some philosophers have argued that there is no grounding for filial duties in current ethical theories. Others have argued that there may be reasons other than duty for doing things for one's parents (for example, friendship). Still others have contended that the problem with grounding filial duty in current moral theory is symptomatic of problems embedded in the theories themselves, located particularly in the impartial ethical principles that comprise these theories, principles derived from and appropriate to relationships between strangers, not those in personal relationships. Recent feminist suggestions that women differ from men in approaching ethical dilemmas and social problems from a “care” rather than a “justice” perspective may point the way to an ethical theory that is better equipped to account for ethical relationships between children and their parents.
